		<p>We are delighted to bring back Key Camp this Summer! The camp will look a little different but feel the same! We are offering three options - Art, Legos & Sports - each option will be limited to 30 students. Additionally, we will have our highly coveted Counselor In Training program for students who have graduated from Key, which will be limited to 10 CIT's per option (Art, Sport & Lego). </p> 
		<p>The camp will be offered for two weeks: June 28th - July 2nd and July 6th - 9th. We will have a morning (9am-12pm) and afternoon (1pm-4pm) session enabling us to thoroughly clean the areas, equipment & supplies between sessions.</p>
                <p>Camp will adhere to all of the Covid re-opening requirements & guidelines to ensure all staff & campers are safe - i.e. - temperature check, self-evaluations, cohorts of 10, etc...</p>
                <p>Please not Ms. Palm will most likely not be on-site during camp but will be here in spirit thru her amazing curriculum and artwork, which will continue! She will be working behind the scenes to ensure that all art participants have the best and most creative two weeks of camp! </p>
